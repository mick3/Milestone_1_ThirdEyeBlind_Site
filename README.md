I want my website to be able to provide the nostalgia of past successes of the band Third Eye Blind (be able to view past music videos, for example) while also informing a new fan of the great music that they create to this day.


I utilized a third party library for the image gallery on the page. This is called "Fancybox" and can be seen from http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/#introduction .

Used this demo to display more than one item in the carousel at a time on large screens. Must utilize media queries to sort out smaller screens though.

image used for background found at: https://substreammagazine.com/2019/07/third-eye-blind-summer-gods-tour-photo/
took an image from https://www.paradiso.nl/nl/programma/third-eye-blind/62618/ to use on the "tour dates" section of the page. Named it "Stephan_Jenkins.jpg"

Changed "<" and ">" arrows on carousel colors because they are not noticeable by default. Also, changed the visibility of the 
indicators that show which area in the available carousel slides are shown. Used these resources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46249541/change-arrow-colors-in-bootstraps-carousel

Used https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/create-text-outline-css/ to create a black outline border on the navbar title "Third Eye Blind" to create separation from the background upon landing and scrolling the page.
