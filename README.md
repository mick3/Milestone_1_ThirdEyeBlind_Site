User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

I want my website to be able to provide the nostalgia of past successes of the band Third Eye Blind (be able to view past music videos, for example) while also informing a new fan of the great music that they create.

took an image from https://www.paradiso.nl/nl/programma/third-eye-blind/62618/ to use on the "tour dates" section of the page. Named it "Stephan_Jenkins.jpg"

I utilized a third party library for the image gallery on the page. This is called "Fancybox" and can be seen from http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/#introduction .

Used this demo to display more than one item in the carousel at a time on large screens. Must utilize media queries to sort out smaller screens though.
