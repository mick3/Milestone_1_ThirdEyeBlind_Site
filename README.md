I want my website to be able to provide the nostalgia of past successes of the band Third Eye Blind (be able to view past music videos, for example) while also informing a new fan of the great music that they create.

took an image from https://www.paradiso.nl/nl/programma/third-eye-blind/62618/ to use on the "tour dates" section of the page. Named it "Stephan_Jenkins.jpg"

I utilized a third party library for the image gallery on the page. This is called "Fancybox" and can be seen from http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/docs/#introduction .
